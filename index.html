    <h2>Villa Coco Guesthouse</h2>
    <p>Villa Coco is a lovely guesthouse in Durban North and ideally situated for all of Durban&rsquo;s fantastic attractions. Convenient for both business and tourism, Durban Country Club, Moses Mabhida, and Kings Park rugby stadiums are close by, while Durban CBD and the ICC are an easy trip into the city, with restaurants and shops minutes away in the  vibrant Broadway area. Suncoast Casino complex, with it's safe swimming beach is only 3km away.</p>
